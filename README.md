# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Learning Points Along the Way

One issue I had from the beginning is not being able to run my project from a starter react native project; something was blocking my ability to run 'npm pod install', which was then further blocking my ability to run the project locally to test while developing. So I pivoted to using Expo, as it was able to run the App in the Expo Go app in the simulators without issue. Although not being very familiar with Expo as a Framework, I found it very familiar to working in normal React Native, with a few change in packages to use, and keywords to understand.

One aspect that was a challenge was the file system, as Expo uses a different structure to what I am use to. I got to grips with using the _layout.tsx file for structuring pages, and honestly, found it more straight forward than something like React Navigation (although loading Modals as a new screen did have me scratching my head for a long minute).

A few points I would like to mention (and to be discussed in a call) is my thoughts on how I would scale this project in the future, and how I would hyperthetically make this project ready for going into Production on an app store;

**Scalability** - One aspect of my Task Manager I would look to change if given the time, would be how the task keys are numbered and how the logic determines what to number a new task. One issue I ran into at a late stage of this project is deleted tasks causing issue for how I was numbering tasks programmically, as it currently uses the number of tasks to determine what the next number in the sequence is, and uses that to allocate a number to the key. This system is rendered useless when, within 5 tasks, task 1 is deleted, causing the next task to be key'd 'task 5', which already exists, therefore it gets overwritten with a new task. In a refactor, I would use something unique, like a number sequence made from days/months/years/hours/minutes, to make the number unreplaceable. This wouldnt affect any other of the apps operations, as they rely on the keys that have been retrieved from Storage to operate. 
I have also begun to implement a team collaboration function, but letting task creators put their name in while creating a task. Going forward, if adapting this for a wider teams use, I would have the app set the name into its own storage, found in a settings or burger menu, and have it populate the task with the pre-set username as it makes new tasks, and then use a service like Axios to send and retrieve tasks as the index page gets revisitied. I would also use the Axios service to perform basic CRUD operations on the tasks, with some validation and authentication.
**Production Readiness** - I feel this project could benefit from more time dedicated to the overall logistics of moving task data from one component to another. This is possibly where I would look to implement Redux, to handle the mutations and changes done to the tasks in different components and for different reasons (like changing tasks status for example). I would also have liked more time to go through and implement more stricter type casting and validating. I was restricted by some difficulty I ran into with satifying promise expectations when trying to pass task data from the helper file to the TasksList. As for App Store readiness, I feel my choice in colours and simplistic design could use some tinkering. I would want to implement a dark and light mode throughout the app, and possible colour schemes for users to pick their favourite colour palettes (especially if the goal of the app is to be their go-to app for task management, UI customisation sounds like an easy win)

All in all, I have enjoyed working through this challenge and getting to grips with a framework I'm not very familiar with, and would spend some time going back through and tweaking parts as I learn more.
